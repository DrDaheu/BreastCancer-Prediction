#Breast Cancer Detection System Using Machine Learning

#Project Overview

This project is a machine learning system for detecting breast cancer, designed to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes. Using a dataset from Kaggle, this system was developed to classify tumor cells as malignant or benign based on several diagnostic features. By employing advanced machine learning techniques, the model achieves high accuracy and robustness, offering reliable predictions to support healthcare professionals.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes labeled instances of breast cancer cases with attributes such as tumor size, texture, and concavity. Before training, the data was carefully preprocessed to ensure quality and consistency. This included handling missing values, scaling features, and balancing classes to mitigate any bias in the modelâ€™s predictions.
